# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Bike Case Study
This is a requirement for Google Data Analytics Specialization Certificate, conducted by Google

### Background
Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company that offers more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Aside from the standard two-wheeled bike, Cyclistic also offers assistive options such as reclining bikes, hand tricycle, and cargo bikes, which considers users with disabilities and those who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The riders using the assistive options make up the 8% of the total riders.

Customers are categorized into casual riders and annual members. Casual riders involve customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes, while annual members purchase annual memberships.

For this case study, I am assuming the position of a Junior Data Analyst at Cyclistic. I am tasked with analyzing the data from casual riders and annual members to provide insights and recommendations that will help the team in designing a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

### Ask
The business task is to provide a new marketing strategy aimed to convert casual riders into annual members.
The following questions will guide the future marketing program:

1.	How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2.	Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3.	How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
    
To help them devise a new marketing strategy, the director of marketing assigned me to answer the first question, <b>“How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?”</b>

### Prepare
As a preparation for the analysis, I downloaded the historical bike trip data which includes data from the previous 12 months. The data is downloaded at [divvy-tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and includes data from July 2022 to June 2023, which is the most recent data. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). The data is also provided in the official website of Divvy Bikes.
The data is organized by the following:
    
1.	The downloaded data are stored in a ZIP folder which includes a CSV file of the bike trip data. 
2.	To store the data, a new folder is created to store the CSV file of 12 bike trip data. 
3.	The filename uses a clear and standard file naming convention of YYYYMM-divvy-tripdata.
4.	Upon checking the columns in each spreadsheet, no personal information are included.
5.	Per the [Divvy Bikes](https://divvybikes.com/system-data) website, trips taken by staff for service and inspection, and trips below 60 seconds in length are not included in the data.
