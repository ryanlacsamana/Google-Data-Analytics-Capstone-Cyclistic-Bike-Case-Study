# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Bike Case Study
This is a requirement for Google Data Analytics Specialization Certificate, conducted by Google

### Background
Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company that offers more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Aside from the standard two-wheeled bike, Cyclistic also offers assistive options such as reclining bikes, hand tricycle, and cargo bikes, which considers users with disabilities and those who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The riders using the assistive options make up the 8% of the total riders.

Customers are categorized into casual riders and annual members. Casual riders involve customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes, while annual members purchase annual memberships.

For this case study, I am assuming the position of a Junior Data Analyst at Cyclistic. I am tasked with analyzing the data from casual riders and annual members to provide insights and recommendations that will help the team in designing a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

### Ask
The business task is to provide a new marketing strategy aimed to convert casual riders into annual members.
The following questions will guide the future marketing program:
    1.	How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
    2.	Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
    3.	How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
To help them devise a new marketing strategy, the director of marketing assigned me to answer the first question, <b>“How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?”</b>
